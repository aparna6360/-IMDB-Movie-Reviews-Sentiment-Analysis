# -IMDB-Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
-----------------------------------------

This project focuses on binary sentiment classification using a dataset of IMDB movie reviews. The goal is to build a deep learning model that can predict whether a movie review is positive or negative based on its textual content. It demonstrates the use of NLP techniques and LSTM neural networks for effective sentiment analysis.

üí° Project Objectives
-----------------------

Build a model capable of understanding the sentiment behind textual data (movie reviews).
Apply preprocessing techniques to prepare raw text data for machine learning.
Train an LSTM-based deep learning model for accurate classification.
Evaluate and visualize the performance of the model.
Provide functionality for real-time sentiment prediction using custom input text.

üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
------------

Source: IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset.
Size: 50,000 reviews.
Classes: Binary (positive, negative).

üîß Tools and Technologies Used
-------------------------------

Python ‚Äì Core programming language.
Pandas, NumPy ‚Äì For data manipulation and numerical operations.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) ‚Äì For tokenization, stopword removal, etc.
TensorFlow and Keras ‚Äì To build and train the LSTM model.
Matplotlib, Seaborn ‚Äì For data visualization and performance plots.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps and Components
----------------------------

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
=============================
Lowercasing, removing HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords.
Tokenizing and padding sequences for uniform input length.

Model Building
==============
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers for sequence modeling.
Embedding layer to convert tokens into dense vectors.
Dropout and Dense layers to prevent overfitting and improve learning.

Model Training & Evaluation
===========================
Trained using binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
Accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix used for performance evaluation.

Prediction Interface
====================
Gradio web interface has been integrated.
Accepts user input and predicts sentiment in real-time.
Useful for deployment or integration into applications.

üìà Results
------------

The LSTM model demonstrated strong performance on the validation set, accurately capturing sentiment in a wide range of reviews.
